The following options are important for tuning Mongoose only if you are 
running with the useUnifiedTopology option:

serverSelectionTimeoutMS - With useUnifiedTopology, the MongoDB driver will try to find 
a server to send any given operation to, and keep retrying for serverSelectionTimeoutMS 
milliseconds. If not set, the MongoDB driver defaults to using 30000 (30 seconds).

heartbeatFrequencyMS - With useUnifiedTopology, the MongoDB driver sends a heartbeat 
every heartbeatFrequencyMS to check on the status of the connection. A heartbeat is 
subject to serverSelectionTimeoutMS, so the MongoDB driver will retry failed heartbeats 
for up to 30 seconds by default. Mongoose only emits a 'disconnected' event after a 
heartbeat has failed, so you may want to decrease this setting to reduce the time between 
when your server goes down and when Mongoose emits 'disconnected'. We recommend you do not 
set this setting below 1000, too many heartbeats can lead to performance degradation.
